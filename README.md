 Nairobi Air Quality Trends: PM2.5 Analysis

 Introduction

This project is a simple attempt to better understand the air we breathe in Nairobi. With increased urban development and traffic, I became curious about how air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has changed over the last year.

I pulled real data from OpenAQ â€” a public open data platform â€” and visualized trends using Python. The idea is to highlight seasonal or daily pollution patterns that could inform personal health choices or even local policy conversations.

 What This Project Does

- ðŸ“¥ Downloads PM2.5 air quality data for Nairobi over the past 12 months  
- ðŸ“Š Analyzes how pollution levels change month by month  
- ðŸ“ˆ Generates a clear line graph showing monthly PM2.5 averages  
- ðŸ§  Helps answer: *Are there better or worse months to be outdoors in Nairobi?*

 Tools Used

- Python
- Requests (API calls)
- Pandas (data cleaning)
- Matplotlib (visuals)

 How to Run It Yourself

Make sure you have Python installed, then:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the required libraries:
